# nova

## What is it?
`nova` is a cli for tasks done on a regular basis. People started to want
to use many of these tasks themselves so I made this general version of it.
Mostly this is a tool for setting up Javascript environments on the fly.

## Install
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mtti-g/nova.git .nova
source .nova/main.sh
```

## API
### install:dev
`nova install:dev` will install the essentials for JS development

## Todo
* make more commands
